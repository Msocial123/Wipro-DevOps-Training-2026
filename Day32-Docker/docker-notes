# docker hub notes

How to push images into docker hub?
===========================

	1. Docker tag:- it is used to specify docker hub username 

docker tag <i-name>  <username/i-image>  

docker fitness-app:v1.0.0  muralisocial123/fitness-app:v1.0.0

	2. Docker login :- you have to login into docker registry using credentials of docker hub.
Docker push :- it is used to push a tagged image only.  - docker push  <tagged-image-name>

Docker Network
============

Container networking refers to the ability for containers to connect to and communicate with each other, and with non-Docker network services.

Containers have networking enabled by default, and they can make outgoing connections. A container has no information about what kind of network it's attached to, or whether its network peers are also Docker containers. A container only sees a network interface with an IP address, a gateway, a routing table, DNS services, and other networking details.

Docker network types
================

    1. Bridge network
==============

Ø Containers will get ip add
Ø Containers can talk each other
Ø NAT used to access internet 
Ø Port mapping required to expose svc
It is for prod use and 90% of real world containers are running on bridge network.

    2. Host Network
==============

Ø Docker will not manage this host network
Ø We cant create custom host network 
Ø Containers will not get any ip add
Ø No NAT 
Ø  no Port mapping 
Ø There is no any isolation for containers
Ø Host network behaves like a process running on host machine
Ø It is a linux host  network 

    3. None network 
==============

Ø No ip
Ø No internet 
Ø No communication 
Ø We cant create custom create network
Ø None network is not a real network driver
It is for database servers
