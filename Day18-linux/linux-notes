	Ø Every file has 3 type permissions

	1. User level
	2. Group level
	3. Other level

Permission types
==============
R -> read permission 
W -> write permission 
X - > executable permission 


	1. Chmod:- change permissions (read, write and execute)
	2. Chown:- change ownership ( user and group)


R -> 4

Syntax :-  chmod who operator permission file

Chmod -> command
Who -> user or group or other
Operators-> +, -
Permission:- r, w,x
file:- file name

	2. Numeric mode (most important for devops)

	Ø Each permission has number value

R -> 4
W -> 2
X -> 1

	Ø We have to add numbers depends on permission

User :- r+w+x -> 4+2+1 = 7 
User2 :- rw-  -> 4+2 = 6 
Group :- --x  -> 1 = 1 
Others:- -w- -> 2 = 2
