Type casting
==========

	Ø It is nothing but converting one datatype into another one is called type casting
	Ø Python dynamically typed, but sometimes we must manually convert data types to perform operations correctly

Why?
=====
	Ø User input always taken as string
	Ø Mathematical operations need numeric types
	Ø combining different data types in programs
	Ø Data processing and formatting 


Types of type casting
===============

	1. Implicit type casting (automatic)
===========================

	Ø Python automatically converts smaller data types into larger ones.


a = 10  # int
b = 2.5  # float 
c = a + b # int automatically converted to float 
print(c)
print(type(c))

	2. Explicit type casting (manual)
==========================

	Ø Programmer manually converts data types using built-in functions.


# string to integer 
x = "100"
y = int(x)
print(y + 50)


# integer to string
a = 25
b = str(a)
print("age is " + b) 



# float to integer 
x = 10.9
y = int(x)
print(y)


# user input examples 
num1 = int(input("enter fisrt number: "))
num2 = int(input("enter second number: "))
print ("Sum =", num1 + num2)


# list to tuple
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = tuple(a)
print(b)


# boolean type casting
print(bool(0))
print(bool(1))
print(bool(""))
print(bool("hello"))
